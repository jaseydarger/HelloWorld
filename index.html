      <h2>Bentley</h2>
      <h3>Bentley 3L became the very first vehicle, built by the British automaker. 3L stands for 3 Litre, and as you
        may have guessed, refers to its engine volume.</h3>
      <a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en/models/aventador" target="_blank"><img src=./lamborghini_aventador_1-200x200%20(1).jpg
          alt="Lamborghini Website" /></a>
      <h2>Lamborghini Aventador</h2>
      <h3>Although Lamborghini is now associated with luxury cars, the company originally made tractors, and this is a
        type of vehicle they still make to this day. He started his tractor company in 1947. After the war, he
        recognized an emerging market for agricultural vehicles and equipment. He used the parts of a former military
        vehicle to create his first ‘Carioca’ tractor. Based on the success of this tractor, he founded his first
        company ‘Lamborghini Trattori’. His tractors stood out because of the fuel atomizer that Lamborghini had
        created himself. One problem for farmers was the cost of petrol. Lamborghini designed the tractors, so they
        would start using petrol but would then switch to using diesel. This was a cost-effective solution for those
        working in agriculture.</h3>

      <h2>Bugatti Veyron</h2>
      <h3>The Bugatti Veyron is one of the fastest, most powerful, most luxurious motor cars available at any price.
        Its specifications are out of this world including a 1200 horsepower, top speed of almost 270 miles an hour,
        and an average price of over two-and-a-half million dollars.</h3>
      <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/" target="_blank"><img src=./mclaren-570s-coupe-3D_200.jpg alt="McLaren Website" /></a>
      <h2>Mclaren</h2>
      <h3>You cannot talk about McLaren without mentioning of its amazing speed and power. McLaren 675LT has 675
        horsepower at 7100 rpm and 700 Nm of torque. Its power to mass ratio is 549 horsepower per ton. It is capable
        of reaching 100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds.</h3>
      <a href="https://global.astonmartin.com/en-us" target="_blank"><img src=./superleggera-07-gq-21dec18_b.jpg alt="Aston Martin Website" /></a>
      <h2>Aston Martin</h2>
      <h3>The original Aston Martin logo was introduced in 1920. It consisted of interlocking capital A and M letters
        inside a circle. The classic variant of Aston Martin logo appeared in 1927, when the original ‘AM’ logo was
        completely dropped. The new symbol consisted of the Aston Martin name immersed within a new wings emblem. The
        wings emblem was borrowed from Bentley, and was meant to represent speed. The name David Brown was added to
        company’s logo in 1947, when Aston Martin was bought by David Brown Engineering Limited. It was removed, when
        company changed its owner. The modern emblem was presented in 2003 and is rather neutral: it consists of iconic
        wings and the Aston Martin name.</h3>
      <a href="https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en-US/home.html" target="_blank"><img src="./200_200.jpg" alt="Rolls-Royce Website" /></a>
      <h2>Rolls Royce</h2>
      <h3>Even though Rolls-Royce has been around for over a century, many parts of these vehicles are still crafted by
        hand (despite being a property of BMW, who mass-produces their normal vehicles). For example, all of the
        interior woodworking and leatherworking is still completed by hand. The “Spirit of Ecstasy” hood ornaments, the
        V12 engine, the radiator, and many other parts are still assembled (if not completely fabricated) by hand. The
        Rolls-Royce professionals that work in the factories have undergone extensive training to ensure that each
        vehicle rolling off the factory floor will meet the extremely high standards put into place for these luxury
        cars. This handcrafting contributes to the high price of the vehicles – but it provides an attention to detail
        and a human touch that cannot be matched by any machine.</h3>

          alt="Corvette Website" /></a>
      <h2>1969 Corvette</h2>
      <h3>The Corvette was finally officially called “The Stingray” in 1969, but remained much the same as the previous
        year. The 327ci V8 was replaced with a 350ci V8, and two ZL-1s were produced which had in the neighborhood of
        585 hp.</h3>
